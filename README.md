## About
School-project: An application that finds information of movies by given title or id. 
This app was made with windows forms.


## Requirements
To use this application you need a valid api-key from https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/ 
At startup app will ask you to enter your api-key to proceed (if you don't already have an ".env"-file with the key in the project folder).


## Using the app
On the right side of the searchbar there is a dropbox where you can choose to search either by id or by title. Enter something in the search bar and press "search".
If you choose to search by title multiple movies may show up in the results-list below and the the first item on the list will be displayed on the left side. To display another movie just click on it's title in the results-list. You can also go further down the list by pressing the "Next Page"-button.
